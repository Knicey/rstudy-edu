Male/Female were representation were about the same (2017) and have generally been for the past 40 years. Age divisions are still about the same.

Status Dropout Rate: Large variation by race. Gender distribution also varied greatly by race. Being born outside the US also seemed to be an indicator. Large variation within Hispanic subgroups},
