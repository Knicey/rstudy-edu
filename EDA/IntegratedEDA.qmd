## Modeling

### 2 Level

#### Unconditional Means

```{r}
#| label: unconditional-means-model

umm_model <- lmer(gys_mn~ 1 + (1|sedaadmin), 
                  data = math_longer)

summary(umm_model)

icc <- 1.6162 / (1.6162 + 0.1475)

```


Interpretations

- The intercept for fixed effects is -0.107 which represents the mean math score across all school districts and years in terms of standard deviations from the 2019 national average.

- The std dev for the random effect intercept is 1.271 which represents the variablity in math scores across school districts from the overall mean (-0.107)

- The std dev for the random effect residual is 0.384 which represents the year to year variability within a school district

### Missing Data

```{r}
#| label: missing-data-analysis

math_longer |> 
  select(gys_mn) |>
  summary()

math_longer |>
  filter(!is.na(total_fed_revenue)) |>
  select(gys_mn) |>
  summary()

math_longer |>
  filter(is.na(total_fed_revenue)) |>
  group_by(stateabb) |>
  count()

math_longer |>
  group_by(stateabb) |>
  count()
  
```


Interpretations

- We see that the states with missing revenue data are disporportionately from Arkansas, Mississippi, and Nevada
- Because of this, I can't perform mean imputation by state
- As such, I will strongly consider not using the revenue data or make a note of this
- I also confirmed all other columns have data for all rows

#### Converting to Categorical?

One idea is to convert revenue to a categorical variable to account for the missing data (e.g. "Not Reported", "0-X", "X-Y", "Y-Z", "Z+")

This could be a good way to account for the missing data, but it might introduce new problems since the missing data does not seem random by the state distribution and the new categorical variable may not be as informative as the continuous variable.

Interpretations

                  data = math_longer)

#### Trimming of Correlated Variables

Variables by Category

- School Modality
  - `share_inperson`
  - `share_hybrid`
  - `share_virtual`
  
```{r}
#| label: correlation-check-modality

math_longer_rev <- math_longer |>
  filter(!is.na(total_revenue))

cor(math_longer_rev |>
  select(
    share_inperson,
    share_hybrid,
    share_virtual
  )
)
 
```

We see that share_inperson and share_hybrid are highly correlated, so we will remove share_hybrid from the model. share_virtual is not as correlated with the other two, so we will keep it in the model.

  
- Revenue/Funding
  - `membership`
  - `total_revenue`
  - `total_fed_revenue`
  - `total_state_revenue`
  - `total_local_revenue`
  - `revenue_per_student`
  - `inst_salaries_per_student`
  - `total_salaries`
  - `total_instructional_salaries`
  - `total_esser1`
  - `total_esser2`
  - `esser_per_student`
  - `total_geer1`
  - `total_geer2`
  - `geer_per_student`
  
```{r}
#| label: correlation-check-revenue

cor(math_longer_rev |>
  select(
    membership,
    total_revenue,
    total_fed_revenue,
    total_state_revenue,
    total_local_revenue,
    revenue_per_student,
    inst_salaries_per_student,
    total_salaries,
    total_instructional_salaries,
    total_esser1,
    total_esser2,
    esser_per_student,
    total_geer1,
    total_geer2,
    geer_per_student
  )
)
```

We see that membership and the total salary variables are highly correlated with all the revenue variables, so we will remove those from the model. All the revenues variables are also highly correlated with each other, so we will just keep one for our model (total_revenue). The variables that were aggregated per student (revenue_per_student, inst_salaries_per_student, esser_per_student, geer_per_student) are not strongly correlated with many variables. We will keep all of these variables and remove the emergency funding variables.
  
- Social Capital
  - `County_Level_Index`
  - `Family_Unity`
  - `Community_Health`
  - `Institutional_Health`
  - `Collective_Efficacy`
  
```{r}
#| label: correlation-check-social

cor(math_longer_rev |>
  select(
    County_Level_Index,
    Family_Unity,
    Community_Health,
    Institutional_Health,
    Collective_Efficacy
  )
)
```

The County Level Index is calculated as a linear combination of the other variables, so we will remove the other variables from the model. This is why we see high correlation among all the variables.
  
- Social Factors
  - `married_household`
  - `married_household_children`
  - `male_married`
  - `female_married`
  - `male_never_married`
  - `female_never_married`
  - `male_divorced`
  - `female_divorced`
  - `over_25_highschool_degree`
  - `over_25_bachelors_degree`
  
```{r}
#| label: correlation-check-social-factors

cor(math_longer_rev |>
  select(
    married_household,
    married_household_children,
    male_married,
    female_married,
    male_never_married,
    female_never_married,
    male_divorced,
    female_divorced,
    over_25_highschool_degree,
    over_25_bachelors_degree,
  )
)
```

We see that the variables related to marital status are highly correlated with each other, so we will remove all but married_household. The variables related to education are surprisingly not highly correlated with each other, so we will keep both of those variables.
  
- Demographics
  - `native_born`
  - `only_english`
  - `non_english`
  - `with_computer`
  - `with_internet`
  - `population`
  - `sex_ratio`
  - `hispanic_percent`
  - `white_percent`
  - `black_percent`
  - `asian_percent`
  
```{r}
#| label: correlation-check-demographics

cor(math_longer_rev |>
  select(
    native_born,
    only_english,
    non_english,
    with_computer,
    with_internet,
    population,
    sex_ratio,
    hispanic_percent,
    white_percent,
    black_percent,
    asian_percent
  )
)
```

We see that native_born, only_english, and non_english are highly correlated with each other, so we will remove all but native_born. The variables related to computer and internet usage are also highly correlated with each other, so we will remove with_internet. The variables related to racial demographics are not highly correlated with each other, so we will keep all of those variables.

white_percent is highly correlated with black_percent, but we will keep both of these variables in the model since they are both important indicators of racial demographics. We would expect this kind of relationship because the variables are percentages and typically sum close to 1.

asian_percent is also highly correlated with population, but we will keep both of these variables in the model since they are both important indicators of demographics.

- Employment
  - `no_workers`
  - `one_worker`
  - `employment_past_year`
  - `unemployment`

```{r}
#| label: correlation-check-employment

cor(math_longer_rev |>
  select(
    no_workers,
    one_worker,
    employment_past_year,
    unemployment
  )
)
```

We see that no_workers and employment_past_year are highly correlated with each other, so we will remove employment_past_year. The other variables are not highly correlated with each other, so we will keep all of those variables.

  
- Income
  - `median_income`
  - `mean_income`
  - `with_health_insurance`
  - `poverty`
  - `owner_occupied_value`
  - `occupancy`
  - `SMOC`
  - `rent`
  - `mortgage_percentage`

```{r}
#| label: correlation-check-income

cor(math_longer_rev |>
  select(
    median_income,
    mean_income,
    with_health_insurance,
    poverty,
    owner_occupied_value,
    occupancy,
    SMOC,
    rent,
    mortgage_percentage
  )
)
```

We see that median_income and mean_income are highly correlated with each other, so we will remove mean_income. median_income is also highly correlated with poverty and the economic variables owner_occuiped_value, SMOC, rent, and mortgage_percentage. We will remove all of these variables except for median_income. The other variables are not highly correlated with each other, so we will keep all of those variables.

median_income is highly correlated with poverty, but we will keep both of these variables in the model for the sake of interpretability since they are both important indicators of economic status.

If we filter variables with t values > 2, we see that the following variables are significant:

```{r}
#| label: significant-variables

summary(ugm3NEW_model)$coefficients |>
  as.data.frame() |>
  filter(abs(`t value`) > 2)
```

This closely alligns with the filtered list from the all-variables model and this is expected since many of those variables that were removed were highly correlated with each other.

In the end we have the following variables

Time
- yearsince2019
- yearsqrdsince2019

School Modality
- share_virtual

Revenue/Funding
- esser_per_student
- geer_per_student

County-Level Demographics
- asian_percent
- unemployment
- median_income
