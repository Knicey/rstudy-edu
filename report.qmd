### References Test

I used the [@shiny] package to create the interactive dashboard and tidyverse [@tidyverse] package for plotting, modeling, and displaying. I referenced several articles and used the academic performance data.

## Introduction

The Covid-19 pandemic has had a profound effect on schools in the US. For many students, the transformation from live personal engagement to remote learning or worse, schools shutting down, has been difficult to adjust to. This struggle is evident when comparing academic performance metrics pre-pandemic to post-pandemic.

My project aims to explore these primary questions:

-   What are the factors that influence the academic performance of school districts?

-   What factors are associated with discrepancies between math and reading academic performance per school district?

Research on the pandemic effect on education has largely demonstrated that lower-income areas are heavily associated with lower academic performance and greater learning loss. The Educational Opportunity Project (EOP) by Stanford University measured the change in test scores between Spring 2019 to Spring 2022 as well as Spring 2022 to Spring 2023 along with comparing by district poverty rates [@fahle2024]. Researchers have also found greater extent of remote learning was a strong indicator for increased learning loss but were not able to identify further strongly related factors. [@fahle2023]. Additionally, there is not extensive research on discrepancies between math and reading scores when it comes to performance as well as recovery. As such, this is one of the knowledge gaps that this project seeks to resolve.

For this project, the academic performance data by school district was from the EOP. Additionally, the 2021 Census supplement on Internet/Computer usage was examined as a potential influence on academic performance and association with discrepancy. This project also used many datasets from the American Community Survey that covered population demographics, socioeconomic variables, child population statistics, and more.

Using this data, I created an interactive shiny dashboard to visualize the factors that could be associated with academic performance and search for potential factors related to math vs reading score discrepancies.

## Background

### New York Times

There have been many articles published by the New York Times discuss data on academic performance over time, across school districts, and compared to numerous socioeconomic factors. [@kane2023] summarizes the findings from the EOP along with other papers and found an association between lower test scores and areas that were poorer, had lower voting rates, had lower institutional trust, and longer school closures. [@mervosh2024] aggregates data from various sources to compare percentage remote/hybrid, family income, and school closure with academic performance.

The trend of discussion appears to have also changed following the end of 2023, in particular, more articles are being published are post-pandemic recovery and strategies that have aided in this process. [@miller2024] synthesized data from the EOP to visualize learning loss recovery across states and note the solutions and strategies that are being employed.

### Education Reporting

The National Center for Education Statistics issues the biyearly National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) in math, reading, writing, and science to analyze academic performance of students in the US [@national]. This organization also developed specially weighted scales to compare the data across grades.

The EOP uses state-administered exams in math and reading across students from grades 3-8 across thousands of school districts over the course of several years [@fahle2024a]. This project also linked these test scores to the NAEP scale for comparability.

I drew heavy inspiration by the plots on the website of the [Educational Opportunity website](https://edopportunity.org/recovery/#/chart/none/districts/mth2223/frl/all/3.15/37.39/-96.78/) where they compared math/reading scores with different socioeconomic factors in a nice comprehensible scatter plot. I noted how effective this method was at mitigating the geographic spread issue so I adapted and extended this idea with my Shiny dashboard. Their dashboard offers filters and divisions by subgroup, subject, and year, but I wanted to extensively look into variables that could be compared to academic performance.

### Government Reporting

The American Community Survey offers a diverse range of population characteristics on a school district level basis and as a result became my primary data source for interesting factors. This is also the source of the socioeconomic data used by the EOP.

## Data

The Eductional Opportunity Project was developed by researchers at Stanford University to study disparities in academic performance across school districts. This project uses state-administered standardized tests across grade 3-8 students in both math and reading with the primary years of interest being 2019, 2022, and 2023. The scores are scaled based off a 2019 national standard that is standardized across all school districts. The grade year standard (GYS) dataset specifically indicates each unit represents a full grade level of proficiency and is comparable across years.

The Current Population Survey (CPS) is a national monthly survey designed to get information about labor statistics in the US. The 2021 CPS Computer/Internet Use supplement was of particular interest because I had a hypothesis that internet/technology usage could one of the primary factors that would differentiate performance in math and reading. As such, I was hoping to compare academic performance and technology usage across matching geographical areas. This did not end up in the final deliverable due to incompatible geographic matching with the academic performance dataset.

The American Community Survey (ACS) is a randomly distributed survey to household owners to collect housing and population statistics. Altogether, the ACS datasets contained aggregate statistics across hundreds of variables [per school district](https://data.census.gov/all?g=010XX00US$9700000&y=2021). The ACS became my primary source for school district data in order to draw comparisons across school districts and academic performance. Many of the datasets were challenging to work with and required a lot of data preparation and cleaning to be machine readable. I ended up using ACS datasets that covered topics in housing, economics, and demographics.

## Methodology

The first step required was to determine what datasets I needed to collect and perform any necessary data cleaning or preparation. The ACS datasets in particular were challenging to work with since they did not have a consistent format pattern and contained difficult to read variable names. Once that preliminary cleaning was completed, the ACS datasets were joined into the EOP dataset by school district name to create a large cumulative dataset. Additionally, I had to pivot longer several fields in order to build interactive elements on my map that relied upon field condensation.

My initial goal was to create a geospatial visualization where school districts across the US could be represented as points and be interacted with to gleam more information. I experimented with various R packages like the maps [@maps], usmap [@usmap], and sf [@sf] packages to determine which had the capabilities, customization, and functionality I was looking for. After experimenting with these maps packages, I began to notice flaws in trying to create this visualization as a central piece of my project. In particular, the housing/income ACS dataset only represented 719 school districts across 34 states which would have not translated well on a map. Additionally, the CPS supplement was distributed by county instead of school district, which made it much more difficult to justify trying to use a map since it couldn't be joined with the EOP data without losing location specificity. As such, I concluded that a map should not be my ultimate goal for the project due to restrictions on the geographic spread of my datasets and that I should instead expand on the scatterplots featured on the EOP website.

I used R Shiny to create interactive properties for my plots, flesh out the functionality, and make additions to my dashboard to make it stand out more compared its inspiration. I added features to better help identify trends like fixed plot scaling, lines of best fit, and a more distinct color gradient. I also wanted to explore more variables and factors that could explain academic performance and specifically discrepancies between math and reading scores. A filter by year was also added to visualize the effect of the pandemic.

## Results

The dashboard I created offers filters and divisions similar to the existing dashboard, but I analyzed a greater number of socioeconomic and demographic factors that could affect academic performance. From plotting socioeconomic factors, it was clear that indicators of areas being lower-income or lower-earning tended to be associated with lower academic performance in both math and reading.

I also made a plot of math vs reading scores and it demonstrated that performance in one subject was indicative of performance in the other across school districts.

## Discussion/Conclusion

My original research questions cannot be conclusively answered from the work of this project. I was able to discover and confirm the findings of many other researchers that lower-income/poorer school districts generally had worse academic performance than high-income/wealthier school districts. However, I was not able to identify any socioeconomic variables that resulted in noticeable discrepancies between reading and math scores. Similarly, the plot of reading scores vs math scores showed that how school districts were performing in one subject reflected how they performed in the other. As such, it remains difficult to answer the second question.

My conclusions matches the findings of other projects . . .

My app in particular looked into the difference between reading and math performance as an interactive tool. Explain what my app does more/how it expands on previous work.

Comparison to the existing dashboard, demonstrate understanding of previous work.

To take this project further, I would like to continue exploring different factors and variables per school district to draw more insights into what seems to affect academic performance. I would also like to include more interactivity with the scatterplot itself to aid in engagement. Additionally, I would also want to look into more COVID-related school district statistics to better demonstrate the effect of the pandemic on academic performance.

## Reflection (not part of report)

I am genuinely really happy with the work I have put in and with the final product that I have developed and will continue to maintain. I am very grateful to Professor Tackett for talking with me throughout the semester and being an incredible mentor for my project.

I think that I spent too much time working with the computer/internet use dataset before realizing its incompatibility with the primary dataset I was working with and in particular not recognizing the limitations of geospatial mapping sooner. I wish that I had started working with the American Community Survey dataset much earlier in the project as I could have been developing the scatter plots much earlier on which would have greatly assisted in app development.

Overall, I recognize that my process and evaluation could be improved greatly but I am nonetheless very proud of my work. To continue with this project, I would want to expand on the district-level variables to further research discrepancies between math and reading performance.
