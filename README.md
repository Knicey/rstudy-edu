# rstudy-edu

This repository contains the code and data used in the research independent study 
on educational policy and the discrepancy between Math/Reading scores over time. 
The repository is organized as follows:

- `data/`: Contains the data used in the study.
- `documenation/`: Contains the documentation for the data.
- `shinyApp/`: Contains the code for the shiny app.
- `EDA/`: Contains the code for the exploratory data analysis.

`DistrictData.qmd` contains my exploration of the academic performance data
`GeospatialMapping.qmd` contains my exploration of the geospatial data from both
the academic performance and the Current Population Survey datasets.

The shiny app can be found at: https://nathany.shinyapps.io/education-statistics/
