# rstudy-edu

This repository contains the code and data used in the research independent study 
on examining how the pandemic has affected acaedmic performance in the US 
and investigating discrepancies between Math/Reading scores over time.
The repository is organized as follows:

- `data/`: Contains the data used in the study.
- `documenation/`: Contains the documentation for the data.
- `shinyApp/`: Contains the code for the shiny app.
- `EDA/`: Contains the code for the exploratory data analysis.

`DistrictData.qmd` contains my exploration of the academic performance data
`GeospatialMapping.qmd` contains my exploration of the geospatial data from both
the academic performance and the Current Population Survey datasets.

The shiny app can be found at: https://nathany.shinyapps.io/education-statistics/
